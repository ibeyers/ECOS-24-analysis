Modelica Models are integrated into an old version of ExternalMedia library (3.3.2) 
Usage of old ExternalMedia Version because it was not yet updated to MSL 4.0.0 at that point in time.
Integration of own models directly into ExternalMedia Library, because OMPython 3.4.0 cannot reliably load additional libraries.
